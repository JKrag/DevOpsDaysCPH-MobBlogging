## Intro
Guide created at DevOpsDaysCPH 2019, as a result of a "Mob blogging" session summarizing the open space discussion before on the topic of Mob programming tips and tricks.

Wedensday there were two mob programming sessions by @EmilyBache and Nicolaj (something, links and stuff!).


## Tips & Tricks
### Use a timer
* Sand clocks were suggested. "Silent alarm", as some don't like beeps.
* Mob Timer apps 
* 5-10 minutes is a good interval. For this blogging, we are going with 5:30
* Some teams write their own. 
  * Interval timer angular app.
  * Writing a timer is a good mob practise exercise
* Research: Are there any IDE plugins?

### Period length
5-10 minutes per interval, but sessions can go on for multiple hours. DOn't forget frequent breaks.
* some suggested a period that allows each team member at least 2 sits as driver.

### Observer group
Emily suggestet size as big as a Scrum Team
For more than six you have a lot of relationships in the room that need to be managed.
For bigger groups, maybe split team, so 5-6 are in rotation, the rest are "observers". 

## Teching mob programing 
- which exercises to use
   FizzBuzz and other coding Katas
   Wargames
   Refactoring Katas, Tennis for example
   
* choose Focus of the Exercise
 * Teaching TDD
 * Teaching the Mob Programming

 * Teach new Language 
 
* DonÂ´t teach too much at once    
* suggestion: only rotate the driver with an experienced navigator


## Distrubuted teams

A few tools were mentioned:
* EtherPad
* VSCode code share
* Online IDE's
