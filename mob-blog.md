# Mob programming tips & tricks

## Intro

## Tips & Tricks
### Use a timer
* Sand clocks were suggested. "Silent alarm", as some don't like beeps.
* Mob Timer apps 
* 5-10 minutes is a good interval. For this blogging, we are going with 5:30
* Some teams write their own. 
  * Interval timer angular app.
  * Writing a timer is a good mob practise exercise
* Research: Are there any IDE plugins?

### Period length
5-10 minutes per interval, but sessions can go on for multiple hours. DOn't forget frequent breaks.
* some suggested a period that allows each team member at least 2 sits as driver.

### Observer group

For bigger groups, maybe split team, so 5-6 are in rotation, the rest are "observers".
